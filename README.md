## PhoneValidator.JS - Frontend and backend validation in tandem

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-blue)

> Three lines front-end and two lines back-end gives you validation working for both client and server. If you only want the backend part, you can of course use only that, and possibly combine it with the React component that intl-tel-input provides [here](https://intl-tel-input.com/examples/react-component.html).

**PhoneValidator.JS** is a wrapper for both frontend and backend validation of international phone numbers using well maintained existing libraries. Front-end as-you-type validation is done via [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input), and backend validation and formatting is done via [google-libphonenumber](https://github.com/ruimarinho/google-libphonenumber) for Node.

Aside from tying the libraries together in a plug-and-play fashion, **PhoneValidator.JS** adds a few small extra features, such as toggling of the input field background color for valid/invalid number, which you may disable, and back-end it returns country name among other properties in the augmented ```number``` object.

**Three lines front-end**
```javascript
const htmlIds = { formId: 'formId', inputFieldId: 'inputId' };
```
The following line also adds the hidden fields ```countryCode``` and ```domesticPortion```. If you via JS call an API rather than conventionally submit the form, loop the input fields and build a ```formData``` object to include these fields in the ```fetch()``` call.
```javascript
let phoneValidator = new PhoneValidatorFE(htmlIds);
```
Lastly, in your form validation, call:
```javascript
if(phoneValidator.validNumber()) {
```

**Two lines back-end**
```javascript
let number = { countryCode: req.body.countryCode, domesticPortion: req.body.domesticPortion };

if(PhoneValidator.isPhoneNumber(number)) {
```
If valid, the ```number``` object now contains for instance:
```javascript
{
  countryCode: '46',
  regionCode: 'SE',
  countryName: 'Sweden',
  domesticPortion: '8 59 67 27',
  full: {
    international: '+46 8 59 67 27',
    domestic: '08-59 67 27'
  }
};
```

Example when the phone number is positively validated by the frontend class ```PhoneValidatorFE``` - the input field background is included in the JS toggle, all other CSS styling is custom for the demo:

Resulting ```number``` object augmented by the backend class ```PhoneValidator``` upon positive validation - getting returned to the frontend just for the demo:

**Brief setup instructions**

**1.** Download **PhoneValidator.JS**

- Put ```src/phoneValidator/``` in your src directory for the backend.

- Put ```public/phoneValidatorFE/``` in your public directory for the frontend.

- Include the two classes where you will use them.

**2.** Install [google-libphonenumber](https://github.com/ruimarinho/google-libphonenumber) for the backend.

- ```npm install --save-prod google-libphonenumber```

**3.** Download [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input) for the frontend and put it in a public directory.

- The required files are: ```build/css/intlTelInput.min.css```, ```build/img/flags.png```, ```build/img/flags@2x.png```, ```build/js/data.min.js```, ```build/js/intlTelInput.min.js``` and ```build/js/utils.js```.

**4.** Include the ```intlTelInput.min.js``` script and the ```intlTelInput.min.css``` file. Set correct paths to ```flags.png``` and ```flags@2x.png``` in the ```intlTelInput.min.css``` file (those may need to be absolute depending on your stack), and check that the path to ```utils.js``` is correct in ```PhoneValidatorFE```.

## Why PhoneValidator.JS

- **Fast and easy.** Thatâ€™s the whole point of it - to quickly get a working solution implemented that combines frontend and backend validation.

  - **Frontend customization:** If you want to, you may provide any ```intl-tel-input``` options inside an optional second argument to the ```PhoneValidatorFE``` constructor. For a full list of options see [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input).

  - **Backend customization:** Likewise, you might want to change things back-end. If you want to add something, see if [google-libphonenumber](https://github.com/ruimarinho/google-libphonenumber) has what you need.

- It makes sense to both validate front-end (blocking the sending of the form if the phone number is invalid) and back-end (so as not to store invalid phone numbers in your database).

- A few things have also been added front-end:

  - Mainly a graphical toggle alternating the background color of the phone number input field. It is on by default, with a transition, but you may deactivate it by providing the object ```options = {toggleColors: false}``` as a second argument to the ```PhoneValidatorFE``` constructor. You may change the default colors if you like, also via the ```options``` object, and you may deactivate or alter the transition. The full options you may use are defined later on this page.

  - The input field now also removes double blankspace and leading whitespace, and before a valid phone number is sent back-end trailing whitespace is also removed.

- A few things have also been added back-end, such as returning not only the full formatted domestic and international number, but also country name (e.g. ```Sweden```), country code (e.g. ```1``` for America), and region code (e.g. ```US```, ```CA``` or ```VA```). Some countries or geographical areas, such as America, the UK and Australia, have several region codes for a single numeric country code, the correct one getting returned depending on the domestic number provided.

  - Also, back-end the parser may crash execution if an invalid number is provided, so we catch that and always return ```false``` if the number is invalid.

## Why not PhoneValidator.JS

- If you have very specific demands, then you should go for a tailor-made solution. ```google-libphonenumber``` is particularly powerful and probably has what you need in that case.

## Miscellaneous

### Terms for different codes

- The official term for alphabetic region code, e.g. ```US```, is "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Country Code".
- Other terms for numeric country code, e.g. ```+1```, are "Country Calling Code" or "Country Dial-In Code".

### "Domestic number" vs. "domestic portion"

Different countries have different rules for how numbers must start when called domestically, which is why ```number.domesticPortion``` may not be a valid number when called domestically. ```number.full.domestic``` however is a valid number when called domestically.

## Detailed instructions

**1.** Download **PhoneValidator.JS**. Put the ```src/phoneValidator/``` directory in your src directory for the backend, and put the ```public/phoneValidatorFE/``` directory in your public directory for the frontend. Include ```PhoneValidator``` and ```PhoneValidatorFE``` where needed.

**2.** Download [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input) and put the files in a public directory, or install via npm, for the frontend. The required files are: ```build/css/intlTelInput.min.css```, ```build/img/flags.png```, ```build/img/flags@2x.png```, ```build/js/data.min.js```, ```build/js/intlTelInput.min.js``` and ```build/js/utils.js```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**a.** Include the ```intlTelInput.min.js``` script and the ```intlTelInput.min.css``` file.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**b.** Set correct paths to ```flags.png``` and ```flags@2x.png``` in the ```intlTelInput.min.css``` file. _Depending on what frontend stack you are using, you may need to make those paths absolute._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**c.** Check that the path to ```utils.js``` is correct in ```PhoneValidatorFE```.

**3.** Install [google-libphonenumber](https://github.com/ruimarinho/google-libphonenumber) via npm, for the backend. ```npm install --save-prod google-libphonenumber```. No requires are needed, as the library is already required in ```PhoneValidator```.

### Frontend

**4.** There is only one mandatory argument to the ```PhoneValidatorFE``` constructor; an object with the two properties ```formId``` and ```inputFieldId```:
  
```javascript
const htmlIds = { formId: 'formId', inputFieldId: 'inputId' };
```

**5.** Then create an instance of the class, providing your ```htmlIds``` object as argument. Among other things, this adds event listeners and also two hidden fields to your form; ```countryCode``` and ```domesticPortion```. When the number is valid, or is being changed from one valid number to another, the values get stored in these two hidden fields.

```javascript
let phoneValidator = new PhoneValidatorFE(htmlIds);
```

**(Extra).** If you want to disable or change the the background color toggle, or use imprecise validation based only on number length, you may provide a second argument ```options``` to the ```PhoneValidatorFE``` constructor. The full available ```PhoneValidatorFE``` options and their default values are listed below. You may also provide ```intl-tel-input``` options via the same ```options``` object. For the full available ```intl-tel-input``` options, see [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input).

_For instance you may want to change the initial country - an intl-tel-input option. Also, if you want to hide the numeric country code next to the flag, provide the ```showSelectedDialCode``` property and set it to false._

**Optional second argument, has these default values:**

```javascript
let options = {

  /* The default PhoneValidatorFE options: */
  
  toggleColors: true,
  colors: {
    valid: '#e4f8e2', /* See (1) below. */
    invalid: '#f8e2e2', /* See (2) below. */
    default: '#ffffff'
  },
  useTransition: true,
  transition: 'background-color 0.3s ease',
  precise: true,

  /* The default intl-tel-input options: */
  
  utilsScript: '../intltelinput/js/utils.js',
  showSelectedDialCode: true,
  initialCountry: 'US'

};
```

(1) ![#e4f8e2](https://placehold.co/15x15/e4f8e2/e4f8e2.png)

(2) ![#f8e2e2](https://placehold.co/15x15/f8e2e2/f8e2e2.png)

For instance, as an example you may try:

```javascript
let options = {
  showSelectedDialCode: false, /* An intl-tel-input option. */
  initialCountry: 'FR', /* An intl-tel-input option. */
  colors: {invalid: '#FF0000'} /* A PhoneValidatorFE option. */
};
```

_If you want to see precise vs. imprecise validation in action, try the US number (999) 999-9999. The frontend validates it positively with imprecise validation, but not with precise. Backend validation returns false either way._

```javascript
let phoneValidator = new PhoneValidatorFE(htmlIds, options);
```

**6.** Then, in your normal frontend form validation code, you may check whether the phone number is valid or not:

```javascript
if(phoneValidator.validNumber())Â {
  /* Form may be sent, as far as phone number is concerned. */
} else {
  /* Prevent API call or conventional form submission. */
}
```

If you are not submitting the form conventionally, as we are in the demos, but are rather using JS to call an API, it is easiest to loop the input fields adding them to the ```formData``` object that you provide to the ```fetch()``` call, for the two hidden fields to be included.

### Backend

**7.** Require the static ```PhoneValidator``` class in your route:

```javascript
let PhoneValidator = require('/path/to/PhoneValidator');
```

**8.** The only public method of ```PhoneValidator``` ```isPhoneNumber()``` takes the object ```number``` as an argument, which requires the following two properties (example of a valid US number). If you use ```PhoneValidatorFE``` front-end these values will have been sent along with the POST request.

```javascript
number: {
  countryCode: '1',
  domesticPortion: '5512948892'
}
```

After execution ```isPhoneNumber()``` returns only the boolean value ```true``` or ```false```, and in the former case it augments the incoming ```number``` object with the following properties (example of a valid Swedish number):

```javascript
number: {
  countryCode: '46',
  regionCode: 'SE',
  countryName: 'Sweden',
  domesticPortion: '8 59 67 27',
  full: {
    international: '+46 8 59 67 27',
    domestic: '08-59 67 27'
  }
};
```

An example of calling ```PhoneValidator.isPhoneNumber()```:

```javascript
let number = {countryCode: req.body.countryCode, domesticPortion: req.body.domesticPortion};
if(PhoneValidator.isPhoneNumber(number)) {
  var valid = true;
} else {
  var valid = false;
}
res.render('somePage', {
  number: number,
  valid: valid
});
```

**9.** Enjoy calling all your international friends.
